# SecInsights2Wix
This is a script created to populate daily cybersecurity insights in wix websites

Initially, I just wanted to populate a website created with a wix website platform, with my desired cybersecurity updates daily,
But then decided to make it a public repo so that other professionals in the field can build upon and utilize this within their own SOC or vCISO org.

This script uses the requests library to send a GET request to an API endpoint that provides cybersecurity industry insights for the current date. The response JSON data is then parsed and the insights are extracted.
Next, the script uses the Wix API to connect to the Wix website and update the content of a specified page with the new cybersecurity industry insights. Finally, a confirmation message is printed to indicate that the update was successful.
Note that this script is just an example and would need to be customized to fit your specific use case, including modifying the API endpoint and parameters, the Wix API key and secret, and the page ID.
